Monitor
======

** Bare-bones monitoring library for Elixir **

Currently, this library wraps around /os-path/to/ping and runs them in parallel.

In the future, it may use Erlang Procket or other library for ICMP...

Also, I would like to add parallel HTTP/HTTPS calls, etc., perhaps using Hackney or HTTPoison.
